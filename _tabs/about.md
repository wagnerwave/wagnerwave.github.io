Welcome! I'm Alexandre Wagner a 26 year old cybersecurity engineer. 

I studied at [Epitech](https://www.epitech.eu/en/).
I worked as a web developer, software developer, thread intelligence analyst and of course cybersecurity engineer.
I'm free lance too, so dont hesitate to contact me, if needed.

I am open minded, friendly and I just try to not be a dump. 

In this blog, you will find some articles I wrote about my passion.
